# Products Manager API

This repository contains the backend API for a full-stack application designed to manage products. This project is a learning exercise to enhance my skills in TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, and Jest for testing. The API is thoroughly documented using Swagger.

## Features

- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed programming to enhance code quality and maintainability.
- **Node.js**: Asynchronous, event-driven JavaScript runtime.
- **Express.js**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Sequelize**: Modern TypeScript and Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server.
- **PostgreSQL**: Powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
- **Jest**: Delightful JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity.

## Documentation

The API is documented with Swagger for easy exploration and testing of the endpoints. You can access the Swagger documentation at `/api-docs` after running the project.
